## Task Description

You are required to analyze Python code samples and infer the types of different elements (e.g., function parameters, local variables, function return types) based on provided JSON schema. Your responses should adhere strictly to the specified JSON format.

## Information Provided

1. Python Code: Enclosed within triple backticks (```).
2. JSON Schema: Outlines the format for type inference.
3. Training Data: Examples of Python code with their inferred types, also within triple backticks.

## Tasks to Perform

1. Type Inference: Based on the provided JSON format, infer the types of various elements in the Python code (function parameters, local variables, function return types) with high accuracy.
2. JSON Response: Provide your inferences in a JSON array of objects, strictly following the training sample format. Exclude any additional information outside of this JSON object.
3. Adherence to JSON Schema: Ensure the output is a valid JSON instance conforming to the provided JSON schema.

## Example:

Python Code with filename 'simple_code.py':
```
def id_func (arg):
    x = arg
    return x

result = id_func ("String")
result = id_func (1)
