## :whale: Running with Docker

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashwinprasadme/TypeEvalPy.git
```

### 2️⃣ Build Docker image

```bash
docker build -t typeevalpy .
```

### 3️⃣ Run TypeEvalPy

🕒 Takes about 30mins on first run to build Docker containers.

📂 Results will be generated in the `results` folder within the root directory of the repository.
Each results folder will have a timestamp, allowing you to easily track and compare different runs.

```bash
docker run \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -v ./results:/app/results \
      typeevalpy
```

🔧 **Optionally**, run analysis on specific tools:

```bash
docker run \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -v ./results:/app/results \
      typeevalpy --runners headergen scalpel
```

🛠️ Available options: `headergen`, `pyright`, `scalpel`, `jedi`, `hityper`, `type4py`, `hityperdl`
