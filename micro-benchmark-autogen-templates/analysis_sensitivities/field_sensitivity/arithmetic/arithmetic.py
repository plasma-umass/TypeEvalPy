# Program defines a class called 'ArithmeticOperation'.
# The class takes two parameters 'a' and 'b' in its constructor, and has a method called 'compute' that computes the sum of the two parameters.
# The class also has a member variable 'result' that stores the result of the computation.
# The given code is an example of field sensitivity because it can recognise values based on the values assigned to its member variables.
